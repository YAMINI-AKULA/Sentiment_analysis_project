🛠️ Using the Amazon Alexa dataset from Kaggle, we crafted a classification model to predict the sentiment of input sentences - a crucial step in understanding customer feedback and enhancing user experience.

📝 Dove deep into the data, 𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐯𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐛𝐚𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐍𝐋𝐓𝐊 𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐤𝐢𝐭 to preprocess text reviews.

📈 After training 𝐑𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭, 𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐗𝐆𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬, we rigorously evaluated their performance with 𝐀𝐔𝐂-𝐑𝐎𝐂 𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬.
