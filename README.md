🛠️ Using the Amazon Alexa dataset from Kaggle, we crafted a classification model to predict the sentiment of input sentences - a crucial step in understanding customer feedback and enhancing user experience.

📝 Dove deep into the data, 𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐯𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐛𝐚𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐍𝐋𝐓𝐊 𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐤𝐢𝐭 to preprocess text reviews.

📈 After training 𝐑𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭, 𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐗𝐆𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬, we rigorously evaluated their performance with 𝐀𝐔𝐂-𝐑𝐎𝐂 𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬.

💻 But the real magic happened with deployment - storing our model with 𝐩𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐥𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐲 and rolling it out via 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐥𝐢𝐭 in 𝐕𝐒𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞. Now, users can effortlessly input reviews and receive automated sentiment analysis in real-time.

🎉 Excited to announce that our model boasts an impressive 𝟗𝟕% 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐲 𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞, providing companies with actionable insights for product development and enhancing overall user experience.
