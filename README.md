# Sentiment_analysis_project

In this project we have explored the amazon alexa reviews dataset from Kaggle and using the techniques like vectorization and bag of words we have converted the reviews column which was originally in text into a combination of 0’s and 1’s. Then we have split the data and trained our three models i.e random forest, decision trees, xgboost and performed our model performance metrics like AUC-ROC curve and confusion matrix. Finally we have choosen XGBoost model as it had better accuracy on the test . We have then used pickle library in python to store our models and then using the vscode we have deployed the model using the streamlit API. We were then able to give an input review to the model in the stream lit API and the model which was running behind it was able to predict the output as negative or positive statement. We were thus able to successfully implement the sentiment analysis models which will automatically detect if the review was positive or negative.
